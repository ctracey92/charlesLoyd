        <h3>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h3>
        <h4>MISSION STATEMENT</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            My design philosophy is that everyone should live, work, and play in spaces that are pleasing to them. Often times simply rearranging the furniture in a room or painting it can totally bring a room to life. All too often, people deny themsleves the pleasure of living in a designed space. They feel that it will be too expensive to hire a designer, or the designer will want the to buy new furnishings. I love to meet clients where they are and to work with what they have. It is important to me to work with their budget to make their space better, more appealing, happier, flow better, etc. The spaces where you spend your time should refect you and your interests. They should be inviting and welcoming, and you should look forward to spending time in them. It is my goal to create a space that you can identify with, that feels like you, perhaps even a better you!
